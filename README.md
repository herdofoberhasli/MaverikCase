# Maverik Case
### Business Problem
Accurate forecasting gives businesses a competitive advantage and makes life much easier for the company from a budgeting perspective. Maverik is regularly opening new stores and has requested a forecasting model that will accurately predict end-of-the-year sales for a brand-new store.
### Solution
A few different machine-learning methods were used to find the best performance. A stacked prediction model with XGBoost as the final model was decided on as the best predictor.
### My Role
Within the team, I was the primary architect behind the final solution and performed significant work in the modeling and data-cleaning parts of the project. 
### Value
An accurate predictive model can provide Maverik flexibility with capital that may otherwise be tied up in an uncertain prediction. Opening processes are streamlined and better planning is enabled.
### Stumbling Blocks
Despite an impressive setup for the stacked model, a fundamental misunderstanding of a Python method resulted in a model that has significant target leakage. The structure likely will provide a still-robust model when the leak is fixed in the future.
### Learning
I ran more machine learning models in these few months than I probably have in my life. This leveled up my skills in this area by a large degree. I feel much more competent as a model architect and have many great ideas for my day-to-day work at my current job. Likely the largest learning area was finding obscure sources of target leakage and fixing those. I am glad I made this mistake in school before I learned the hard way at work.
